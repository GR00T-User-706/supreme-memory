# HOW TO: Create Basic but still Strong AI Prompts
### The Beginning - start small 
---


## 1 Start with strong Verbs, be clear with intent.
---
- "Create",
- "Write",
- "produce",
- "Generate",
- "Display",
- "Demonstrate",
- "Build"
not: "Can you provide info on AI trends?"
do: Generate a report on the latest AI trends."
```
"Build a (___________), It needs to follow these PARAMS (_____________),
 It needs to perform at (________%) effectivness/efficiantcy level"
```
```
"Generate a report of the top 10 generative revenue sources"
```
---
## 2 Add context
---
Provide relevant background info.
Example: Asking for marketing strategies? Mention industry, target audiance, objectives.
Context creates clear understanding of needs.

## 3. be clear and specific.
---
- add as much, precise, clear, and relevant data, as possible to generate the outcome with the highest perceived value rate or percent chance to succeed.

## 4. Experiment and iterate.
---
- edit and resubmit your prompts to refine the outcome untill the desired effect has been acheived
- it takes time to build a powerfull highly engineered persona;  Unless your a talented creative writer, dont expect to get it right the first time. 

## 5. use examples
---
- clearly describe expected outcomes by explaineing expected outcome.
- style, power, performance, expected results and potential workflow.
## 6. specify the length.
**Prompt keywords to control output length**

| Desired length | Keywords to prepend/append in the prompt |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Very short / bullet‑point | *brief*, *concise*, *summary*, *in a nutshell* |
| Short paragraph | *short*, *compact*, *to the point* |
| Medium detail | *moderate length*, *balanced*, *full answer* |
| Long / thorough | *detailed*, *comprehensive*, *in‑depth*, *elaborate* |
| Very long / exhaustive | *extensive*, *full‑scale*, *complete analysis*, *cover all aspects* |

Add the chosen keyword(s) at the beginning of your request (e.g., “**Briefly** explain…”) or at the end (“Explain… **in a concise manner**”).
a concise answer, a paragraph, an essay, indicate length as needed.
```
Generate a (__________) that describes the effects of (____________) on (____________), that (___________) to accomplish this outcome.
```
## 7. GUIDE THE (AI)

- sometimes its most beneficial to provide EXPLICIT instructions to the AI. specify what rules need to be included, avoided, prioritized, and flow.
- precision and relevent details over vaque unclear ques.

## 8. Clarify the Tone.
record, review, refine, regularly, for best results.
```
Generate a definitive compilation of the top 25 generative income revenue sources with the greatest potential profit margin.
organized as follows; start-up-cost ordered /L-H. that explain the Pros, Cons, MVP (Minimum Viable Product), Target audiance,
Best Marketing strategies, potential start-up cost, any prerequisite requirments (skills, tools, hardware, softwear, *),
